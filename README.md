# Starbecue

Starbecue is an 18+ fetish mod created for starbound that focuses mainly on Vore, Macro/Micro, and Transformation fetish content as well as many adjacent kinks.

The mod has a opt-in based consent system for deciding what sort of actions you are subject to, as well as perform on other characters whether they be player or NPCs. While there is no way to prevent one from viewing other characters performing actions one may not have opted in to, those actions cannot be performed on you by anyone, and NPCs will ignore you when seeking out those actions. NPCs can also be configured ingame in much the same way players can configure themselves, however, certain OCs may have certain settings locked to a specific value by their owner, please respect their wishes.

Check out `features.md` for a comprehensive list and explaination of every feature in the mod, this is also where you'll find the list of compatible modded races in this version.

`FAQ.md` has a number of frequently asked questions, make sure to check it to see if theres an answer for you before poking any of the developers about it.

`documentation.md` documents the changes made to the starbound executable that were made to be able to do the things I do in this mod.

# Install

Starbecue requires a modified executable that both improves and expands features of the game for modders to take advantage of, most feature changes were to be in service of achieving the intended fetish content in an easier manner, however the changes to the engine itself do not include any fetish specific content, and are not exlusively in service of such content, most overall were meant to improve the game experience for players and modders.

If one wishes to use the modified engine without the fetish content, simply remove `starbecue.pak` from the mods folder, but keep `SBQ_engine_assets.pak` as the modified engine needs it to function.

Make sure to delete any previously installed versions of starbecue within the `Starbound/mods/`
This includes any version of `starbecue.pak` and `starboundSpeciesAnimOverrides.pak` or `SBQ_engine_assets.pak`

**Starextensions is incompatible with any modified executable, remove it if it is installed!**

Latest versions are available on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/LokiVulpix)

This mod Requires [Stardust Core Lite](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2512589532) or [Stardust Core](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=764887546)

Further steps are somewhat OS specific!

## Windows

### Setup Script
Double dlick the provided `setup.bat` file to execute it

The script has will have copied the files into the default steam starbound install, you can now play starbound with the mod!

if this didn't work, try manual setup, or open the script in a text editor and change the starbound directory path to where yours is located.

### Manual Setup
Open the `Starbound` directory by viewing its properties on steam, and clicking `Browse` on the `Installed Files` tab

Place `starbecue.pak` and `SBQ_engine_assets.pak` files within `Starbound\mods\`

if you downloaded the win64 version, you're going to open the `Starbound\win64\` folder

Replace the `starbound.exe` file with the provided version
if you are running a server, also replace `starbound_server.exe` provided seperately

## linux

### Setup Script

Open the diretory containing these files within terminal, this can be done by left clicking the folder and selecting "New Terminal At Folder" or opening terminal and using `cd` to open the directory by typing the path (you can simply drag the folder into terminal rather than typing the path manually)

Input the following commands
`chmod +x ./install.sh`
`./install.sh`

The script should have copied the files into their correct place, you can now play starbound with the mod!

if this didn't work try manual setup, or open the script in a text editor and change the starbound directory path to where yours is located.

### Manual Setup

Open the `Starbound` directory by viewing its properties on steam, and clicking `Browse` on the `Installed Files` tab

Place `starbecue.pak` and `SBQ_engine_assets.pak` files within `Starbound/mods/`

Replace the `starbound` file within `Starbound/linux/` with the provided version

Replace the `starbound_server` file within `Starbound/linux/` with the provided version if you are running a server

View the file properties on each executable and enable them as executables

## macOS
Sadly macos can not be supported due to Apple being Apple. Even if I did figure out how to make my machine properly include the libraries in the executable when I compile it, Apple simply would not allow the executable to run on other computers, without me purchasing a license for $99 USD or however much it is now.

## Uninstall

Open the `Starbound` directory by viewing its properties on steam, and clicking `Browse` on the `Installed Files` tab

delete `starbecue.pak` in the `mods` folder

If you are playing with other players who have the same SBQ executable, but simply do not wish to have SBQ content, you can stop here, following steps are for true full uninstall.

delete `SBQ_engine_assets.pak` in the `mods` folder

return to the `Installed Files` tab in steam and select `Verify integrity of game files`



Steam will then re-download the unmodified versions of the game executable
