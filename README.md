# Starbecue

Starbecue is an 18+ fetish mod created for starbound that focuses mainly on Vore, Macro/Micro, and Transformation fetish content as well as many adjacent kinks.

The mod has a opt-in based consent system for deciding what sort of actions you are subject to, as well as perform on other characters whether they be player or NPCs. While there is no way to prevent one from viewing other characters performing actions one may not have opted in to, those actions cannot be performed on you by anyone, and NPCs will ignore you when seeking out those actions. NPCs can also be configured ingame in much the same way players can configure themselves, however, certain OCs may have certain settings locked to a specific value by their owner, please respect their wishes.

# Install

Starbecue requires a modified executable that both improves and expands features of the game for modders to take advantage of, most feature changes were to be in service of achieving the intended fetish content in an easier manner, however the changes to the engine itself do not include any fetish specific content, and are not exlusively in service of such content, most overall were meant to improve the game experience for players and modders.

If one wishes to use the modified engine without the fetish content, simply remove `starbecue.pak` from the mods folder, but keep `SBQ_engine_assets.pak` as the modified engine needs it to function.

Make sure to delete any previously installed versions of starbecue within the `Starbound/mods/`
This includes any version of `starbecue.pak` and `starboundSpeciesAnimOverrides.pak` or `SBQ_engine_assets.pak`

**Starextensions is incompatible with any modified executable, remove it if it is installed!**
