# Starbecue

Starbecue is an 18+ fetish mod created for starbound that focuses mainly on Vore, Macro/Micro, and Transformation fetish content as well as many adjacent kinks.

The mod has a opt-in based consent system for deciding what sort of actions you are subject to, as well as perform on other characters whether they be player or NPCs. While there is no way to prevent one from viewing other characters performing actions one may not have opted in to, those actions cannot be performed on you by anyone, and NPCs will ignore you when seeking out those actions. NPCs can also be configured ingame in much the same way players can configure themselves, however, certain OCs may have certain settings locked to a specific value by their owner, please respect their wishes.

# Install

Starbecue requires a modified executable that both improves and expands features of the game for modders to take advantage of, most feature changes were to be in service of achieving the intended fetish content in an easier manner, however the changes to the engine itself do not include any fetish specific content, and are not exlusively in service of such content, most overall were meant to improve the game experience for players and modders.

If one wishes to use the modified engine without the fetish content, simply remove `sttarbecue.pak` from the mods folder, but keep `SBQ_engine_assets.pak` as the modified engine needs it to function.

On a fresh install make sure to delete any previously installed versions of starbecue within the `Starbound/mods/`
This includes any version of `starbecue.pak` and `starboundSpeciesAnimOverrides.pak` or `SBQ_engine_assets.pak`

**Starextensions is incompatible with any modified executable, remove it if it is installed!**

Latest versions are available on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/LokiVulpix)

This mod Requires [Stardust Core Lite](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2512589532) or [Stardust Core](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=764887546)

While not required it is recommended you install the Monster Config Core Loader mods found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442860690) and [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442873217), if you're using Stardust Core then you should get [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2690363974) and if you're using FU you'll also need [this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2442880727) because it should fix potential compatibility issues.

# Getting Started

On creation of a new character, a popup menu will open up to allow one to quickly assign vore preferences, as well as an agreement to enable yourself to use the mod's content. To change those settings and access further settings, then open the toobar and select **Starbecue Settings** to open the settings menu.

To get started with the mod, all you need to do is open your crafting interface, and craft the **SBQ Controller** this is the main item used to perform actions, and can be re-assigned via it's action wheel.

Available actions are determined by your current species, what sort of state you're in, and most importantly, what settings you have enabled. Actions you cannot perform with your current settings will not be displayed to you, so if you think you're missing some actions, go check your settings. And if the requisite settings aren't being displayed, then it's just not something the current species can do.

More content can be found via discovering **Auri's Shop** which you can get to via some mysterious fireplaces you might find on lush planets, they look like this:

## Settings Overview
The settings are accessed via the toolbar and selecting **Starbecue Settings**.

The **Main** tab is mostly focused with predator based settings, changing what effects your body has and etc. Some settings are specific to your current species, though most are global. Some settings are also reliant on other preferences to be displayed.
Eg: Cock Vore related settings will not be shown if one has not selected that they are a Cock Vore Pred.

The **Prefs** tab controls consent based settings on what actions you can perform and what can be performed on you, as well as modifiers on how much they might be able to effect you.

The **Help** tab contains general information about the mod, it probably contains the same information in this readme!

Depending on your species, you may also find an additional tab with a manual to explain that species' specific capabilities!

You can also use the **Nominomicon** to open the settings page for any SBQ Compatible NPC, Monster, or Object to edit their settings and read their manual in the same manner as you would for yourself, however OC NPCs may have certain settings locked to a specific value by their owner.

# Being a Pred

To be a pred, one must have opted in to being pred for the relevant vore type. One can also choose whether other characters must ask consent for the relevant actions.
Eg: If you select **Oral Vore** pred, but don't require consent, you're allowing prey characters to attempt to force their way inside you. If consent is enabled, then you will recieve a prompt to confirm or deny requests, but you will still be able to attempt the action yourself freely.

To perform predator actions, one requires a **SBQ Controller** these can be crafted for a single pixel. Open the action wheel and assign an action, available actions are determined by what settings you have enabled, as well as what species you are.

The action wheel will also let you release any prey you have eaten, or select a specific prey to perform prey specific actions only available through this menu and the predator HUD.

In the bottom right you will have a HUD to show you the health of your current occupants, as well as the progress bar for any extra effects they are currently being subject to. This HUD will also allow you to quickly change the current digest effect for the selected location, as well as select prey to perform actions on them.

The big red "Lock Down" button will put you into "Lock Down" mode, which nullifies your base passive energy regen, but will prevent any prey from escaping until you run out. If you're in this mode you'll have it indicated with your status effects.

# Being Prey

To be prey, one must have opted in to being prey for the relevant vore type. One can also choose whether other characters must ask consent for the relevant actions.
Eg: if you select **Oral Vore** prey, but don't require consent, you're allowing pred characters to attempt to eat you without asking. If consent is enabled, you will recieve a prompt to confirm or deny requests, but you will still be able to attempt the action yourself freely.

When you've been eaten a HUD will open up in the bottom right, indicating the directions one can press to cause a struggle animation. The color of the indicator arrow hints at what struggling in that direction might do for you.

Holding **Shift** will prevent any actions from occuring from your struggles, only playing the animations, such as if one didn't want to escape.

- Red
> You might be able to escape the pred.
- Blue
> Might make the pred change state.
- Green
> Might make the pred change state, or let you move to another location in the predator's body, regardless it'll be easier for you to escape.
- Cyan
> Might let you move to another location within the predator's body.
- Yellow
> Might get the pred to perform some sort of action on you.
- (Locked)
> Pred is in "Lock Down" mode, you won't be able to escape until they've exhausted too much energy from your struggling.

If you ever find yourself in a situation that's over your head, and you want to immediately get out of it, there is an Instant Escape Combo. To perform it, hold **Shift**+**Down** then press **Jump**.

# Transformation

After being transformed into enough different species, you will unlock the **Shapeshifter** tech, which can then be used to freely transform into any species you have been before. A quick way to unlock this would be to buy several mysterious potions from the shop, or spawn in Predator Tenants of various species and get them to transform you.

If the settings aren't enabled for it, most potions are temporary and you will usually return to your original species within 5-10 minutes depending on the transformation method, if even then you haven't turned back, simply get a **Reversion Potion** from the shop.\nDo note that if you have permanent TF enabled, any transformation will set in 'permanently' and cause it to be the new species you 'revert' back to.

Transformations via the **Shapeshifter** tech are always treated as indefinite, even without the setting enabled.\nThe tech can also be used to customize your appearance as each individual species, you can even change which name you use as that species! This is quite useful for RP purposes to 'change character' without having to have seperate character saves to play as.

TF as a result of clone potions overrides your specific customization and changes your name, this is only temporary! If it happens to be the first time you TF into that species, it will end up being saved, otherwise it will never replace your saved customization so don't worry about playing around with them!

In any case where your name is changed while in active gameplay, while it is saved in character data, one cannot change the client connection name on a server without disconnecting and re-connecting, so instead we simply have it pretend you used the '/nick' command to change your server nickname.
