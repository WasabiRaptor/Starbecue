when above 90% hunger it cuddles its prey if it goes below 90% while your still cuddling it noms
when above 60% hunger it stays stationary but wants food
when below 60% it starts to roam around for food stalking players and npc's trying to eat em
when at 0% it starts to fly around swooping down at prey

its maximum height is 8 a 9 blocks when standing still. 6 to 7 when moving leaning a bit forward
crouching down to fit trough doors if they can be opened slowing him down 

if it captures its prey it brings them back to its nest depending on its hunger.
breaking free is much harder when he's moving around but his digestion is slowed but when he reaches where his nest is aka his spawn point he will digest faster but breaking free is a bit more easy'r stunning him a bit if you do so but this will make him lose more hunger points (hope you bought that tazer or have distractions if he's gona hunt you)

if its hunting or being shot at from a distance it can inhale powerfully to pull prey into his maw

the tazer effects
on 90% hunger or higher it try's to nom them followed up by a full tour
on 60% it quickly leaps at them chasing them down if caught digestion follows immediately 

below 60% while its hunting can be used to escape from it but still pisses him off
at 0% it forces it to land and go after you on foot for 30 seconds

leaving food on the ground while its wandering around will make it pick it up
