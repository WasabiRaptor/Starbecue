If consent is enabled, then you will recieve a prompt to confirm or deny requests, but you will still be able to attempt the action yourself freely.\n \nTo perform predator actions, one requires a ^yellow;SBQ Controller^reset; these can be crafted for a single pixel. Open the action wheel and assign an action, available actions are determined by what settings you have enabled, as well as what species you are.\n \nThe action wheel will also let you release any prey you have eaten, or select a specific prey to perform prey specific actions only available through this menu and the predator HUD.\n \nIn the bottom right you will have a HUD to show you the health of your current occupants, as well as the progress bar for any extra effects they are currently being subject to. This HUD will also allow you to quickly change the current digest effect for the selected location, as well as select prey to perform actions on them.\n \nAnd should someone seek to enhance their power... melt their prey with greater power, they may be able to forge a special treat with each new resource they discover.\n \nThe big red ^red;Lock Down^reset; button will put you into ^red;Lock Down^reset; mode, which nullifies your base passive energy regen, but will prevent any prey from escaping until you run out.

This is quite useful for RP purposes to 'change character' without having to have seperate character saves to play as.\n \nTF as a result of clone potions overrides your specific customization and changes your name, this is only temporary! ^#555;Unless it isn't ;)^reset; If it happens to be the first time you TF into that species, it will end up being saved, otherwise it will never replace your saved customization so don't worry about playing around with them!\n \nIn any case where your name is changed while in active gameplay, while it is saved in character data, one cannot change the client connection name on a server without disconnecting and re-connecting, so instead we simply have it pretend you used the '/nick' command to change your server nickname.",
