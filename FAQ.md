### Q: NPC/Monster/Object won't do X vore action!
### Q: I can't do X vore action!
> Things like Cock Vore and Breast Vore need the relevant body parts to be selected.
> Check the pred's settings, make sure it's enabled, if it is, check the target's settings, they might be disabled or locked.

> Certain species or NPCs may have certain settings locked.
> Admins can configure to disable/lock certain actions on a server wide or per world basis using commands.

### Q: I'm a server admin and I would like to disable certain things.
> use the `/sbq config` command to open a menu, if you're host you'll be allowed to assign overrides globally to the server.

### Q: Why can't I eat more prey even though I have hammerspace?
> You are limited to a certain number of prey slots, determined by how many of SBQ's rock candies you've eaten to upgrade your vore power, it eventually caps at 32 slots.

### Q: If I get transformed and upgrade my ship while a different species will it break?
> Thats a 'bug' in retail from modifying player data, and fixed in OSB by having the ship's species as a seperate value in the player/ship data.

### Q: I got transformed but don't like how I look!
> `/sbq customize` will open a little menu to change your appearance for your current species.

### Q: What species are supported?
> Theres a list of the species supported [here](https://github.com/WasabiRaptor/Starbecue/blob/master/features.md#compatible-species)

### Q: Can X species be supported?
> It might! and I'm gonna need yooooour help! Use this [template](https://github.com/WasabiRaptor/SBQ-Race-Compatibility-Tempate) which will work with most species, and then send me the files afterwards. You can also see all the existing compatibility patches [here](https://github.com/WasabiRaptor/SBQ-compatibility) if you need examples.
> I take requests from patrons for species compat from time to time, it will probably be faster if you do it yourself, its not very hard, and a fan has provided a video tutorial that will cover how to do most custom races.

### Q: What are all these different mods in the zip?
> They are explained in the readme [here](https://github.com/WasabiRaptor/Starbecue/blob/master/README.md#included-mods)

### SSVM
> Make sure you're using [this version](https://github.com/Zygahedron/StarboundSimpleVoreMod) As the original version of the mod has been broken for years now.
> Hasn't been a dependency for years
> I didn't ever work on SSVM itself, early versions of SBQ started as an add on, but had any code from SSVM it relied on replaced with my own in version 2.0 and then the mod has since been fully rewritten again for 3.0 and then another big rewrite for 4.0 So this mod is an entirely different beast by this point.
> SBQ is not incompatible with SSVM, however I will make no personal effort for parity, as SSVM is ancient, and unmaintained.

### StarPounds
> Shouldn't be incompatible as far as I know.
> No parity has been added yet.
